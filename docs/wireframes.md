Below, in a .png file, you will find two wireframes for ABQ Trails. The first shows the process a user will use to explore available trails on the map and get a Quick View pop up for the trail marker they tap on. The second shows the screen a user will come to if they either long press a trail marker or tap on the quick view pop-up belonging to the immediately previously selected trail marker.

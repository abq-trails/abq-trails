Ground Rules for Team Awesome!
==============================

1. Our time is important!
2. We will use Slack as our primary means of communication and will use email and file hosting services (e.g. Gmail and Google Docs) to transfer Slack-incompatible files.
3. Group meetings will happen according to the following

    * Mid-week for SCRUM sessions
    * Fridayâ€™s for a brief update up to an hour and/or if needed a longer sessionc.
    * Saturdays occasionally for longer sessions with proper notification.
    
4. Personal and group assignments and weekly agendas will be distributed via email and must be completed and or followed up on before the next group session.

5. We are a team! We operate on a "No one is left behind" policy. If one of us falls behind, the rest of the team will be there to catch them up.
